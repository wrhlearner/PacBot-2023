IR CONN HEADER R/A HEADER MALE,"This sensor is a carrier/breakout board for ST¡¯s VL6180X proximity and ambient light sensor, which measures the range to a target object up to 20 cm away (or 60 cm with reduced resolution). The VL6180X uses time-of-flight measurements of infrared pulses for ranging, allowing it to give accurate results independent of the target¡¯s color and surface. Distance and ambient light level measurements can be read through a digital I2C interface. The board has a 2.8 V linear regulator and integrated level-shifters that allow it to work over an input voltage range of 2.7 V to 5.5 V, and the 0.1¡å pin spacing makes it easy to use with standard solderless breadboards and 0.1¡å perfboards.","U1, U3, U4, U6",VL6180X,VL6180X,4,7-Pin R/A Male headers per IR,https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/adam-tech/PH1RB-14-UA/9831063?utm_adgroup=Rectangular%20Connectors%20-%20Headers%2C%20Male%20Pins&utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=Shopping_Product_Connectors%2C%20Interconnects_NEW&utm_term=&utm_content=Rectangular%20Connectors%20-%20Headers%2C%20Male%20Pins&gclid=CjwKCAjw_MqgBhAGEiwAnYOAejAbtTqXabENRAXP2u8fN9nntNeUbVp1pwD-yYO_9saqioDVWyq7vhoCJtIQAvD_BwE,https://www.pololu.com/product/2489/resources
