[2022 UCLA Micromouse tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHWE3d_au30&list=PLAWsHzw_h0iiPIaGyXAr44G0XfHfyjOe7): mechanisms about components we will use, including battery/power, motors, magnetic encoders, PID control, IR sensors, and PCB design tips. Suggest to watch Lecture 1 Battery Safety and Usage (4:24-6:37) before touching the LiPo batteries. It will literally explode.
